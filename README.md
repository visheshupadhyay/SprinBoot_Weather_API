# SprinBoot_Weather_API
This application is a SpringBoot server that integrates with the Weather API from RapidAPI. It exposes RESTful APIs to retrieve the weather forecast summary and hourly forecast details of any city. The API requests are secured with a header-based authentication mechanism that uses a randomly generated client ID and client secret.
